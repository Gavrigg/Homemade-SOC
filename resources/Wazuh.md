# Wazuh Overview

It also includes capabilities for **regulatory compliance** by automating audits for standards such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and HIPAA. 
Furthermore, its **file integrity monitoring** (FIM) and vulnerability assessment tools provide proactive measures to secure critical systems.  

## Key Advantages of Wazuh  

- **Cost-Effective Security**: Unlike proprietary SIEM tools, Wazuh is entirely free and open-source, reducing total cost of ownership.  
- **Customizability**: The platform's modular design allows users to tailor its features to meet specific organizational needs.
