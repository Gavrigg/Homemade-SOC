# Wazuh Overview

Wazuh is an open-source platform for threat detection, compliance management, and security monitoring. As both an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 
and a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) tool, it provides a centralized approach to managing and analyzing security data. 
Its modular architecture allows for flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for organizations of any size.  

One of Wazuh's standout features is its **cloud compatibility**, offering seamless integration with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. 
It also includes capabilities for **regulatory compliance** by automating audits for standards such as PCI DSS, GDPR, and HIPAA. 
Furthermore, its **file integrity monitoring** (FIM) and vulnerability assessment tools provide proactive measures to secure critical systems.
