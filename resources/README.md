## Incident Handler's Handbook
For incident detection and response management, I have used the well-known paper [Incident Handler's Handbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fMS-1aUAI9rUV8RbDVTQNS9cdfwZcqhD/view?usp=drive_link) by Patrick Kral. The choice of SANS's "Incident Handler's Handbook" is based on its recognized authority and practical approach to cybersecurity incident management. SANS Institute is one of the most important references in the training and certification of computer security professionals, and its manual is a complete and accessible guide to establish effective procedures for incident response. With a clear and detailed structure, the book covers everything from the initial detection phases to post-incident resolution and analysis, providing a comprehensive and strategic vision for professionals in charge of handling security incidents. The decision to include this source in the project is justified by its direct applicability to the needs of a SOC, as it is a tool that not only establishes good practices, but also offers practical approaches adaptable to different environments, such as the domestic SOC that is intended to be developed in this project.

> An incident is a matter of when, not if, a compromise or violation of an organization’s security will happen. The preparation of the Computer Incident Response Team (CIRT) through planning, communication, and practice of the incident response process will provide the necessary experience needed should an incident occur within your organization. Each phase from preparation to lessons learned is extremely beneficial to follow in sequence, as each one builds upon the other. The following phases will provide a basic foundation to be able to perform incident response and allow one to create their own incident response plan.

## ISO 27001
The [ISO 27001](https://www.globalsuitesolutions.com/what-is-the-iso-27001-standard-and-what-is-its-purpose/) standard is an international standard that establishes the requirements for the implementation, maintenance, and continuous improvement of an Information Security Management System (ISMS). This system is used to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. The standard provides a framework for information security that helps organizations identify and effectively manage their information security risks. La norma ISO 27001 se aplica a cualquier tipo de organización, incluyendo pequeñas y medianas empresas, grandes corporaciones, instituciones gubernamentales y sin fines de lucro. También se puede aplicar en cualquier sector, incluyendo tecnología de la información, finanzas, salud y servicios públicos.


### ISO 27001 Implementation Process

The ISO 27001 implementation process is divided into four phases: planning, implementation, assessment and continual improvement.
Planning Phase

During the planning phase, the organization identifies its information security requirements and establishes a plan to implement the ISMS.
Implementation Phase

The implementation phase includes creating policies, procedures and controls to protect information.
Assessment Phase

During the assessment phase, the organization assesses the effectiveness of its ISMS and identifies areas for improvement.
Continual Improvement Phase

The continual improvement phase involves identifying and implementing improvements to the ISMS processes and controls.

Once implemented and certified, the ISMS must be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure its continued compliance with information security requirements. ISO 27001 certification, although not mandatory, can also improve brand image and customer trust, as it demonstrates that the organization is committed to protecting information, as certified by an independent certifying body.

In addition, ISO 27001 can be integrated with other standards and frameworks to achieve more complete and effective management of information security in an organization. These include ISO 31000 for carrying out risk analysis and management, or ISO 22301 for business continuity management, among others. However, it is important to note that, although ISO 27001 can be integrated with these standards and frameworks, each has its own focus and specific objectives.


### Structure of the ISO 27001 standard
- **Introduction**: Provides an overview of the standard, its purpose, and its relationship to other information security standards and frameworks.

- **Scope**: Describes the scope of the standard and sets out the boundaries of the application of an organization's Information Security Management System (ISMS). This includes identifying the information assets that are covered by the standard and the activities, processes, and geographic locations included in the scope.

- **Normative references**: References other relevant standards, laws, and regulations that must be considered in the design, implementation, and maintenance of the ISMS. This includes international information security standards such as ISO 27000, privacy and data protection laws, industry-specific regulations, and other information security frameworks.

- **Terms and definitions**: Provides clear definitions of key terms and concepts used in the standard to ensure a common understanding of the requirements.

- **Organizational context**: Describes the requirements for understanding the context of the organization, including its structure, objectives, needs and stakeholder expectations. This helps the organization identify and assess the risks and opportunities relevant to its ISMS.

- **Leadership**: Sets out the leadership and top management commitment requirements for the ISMS. This includes assigning roles and responsibilities, communicating the information security policy and establishing objectives and continual improvement plans.

- **Planning**: Describes the requirements for planning the ISMS, including identifying and assessing risks and opportunities, defining security objectives and requirements, selecting security controls and developing implementation plans.

- **Support**: Sets out the requirements for the resources needed to implement and maintain the ISMS, including personnel, infrastructure and financial resources. It also includes requirements for competence, awareness and communication in the organization.

- **Operation**: Describes the requirements for the implementation and operation of the ISMS, including risk management, information security, access control, business continuity and other security controls. Requirements for documentation and record control are also included.

- **Performance evaluation**: Establishes the requirements for monitoring, measuring, analyzing and evaluating the performance of the ISMS. This includes conducting internal audits, management reviews and conformity assessments. Requirements for continual improvement of the ISMS are also included.
